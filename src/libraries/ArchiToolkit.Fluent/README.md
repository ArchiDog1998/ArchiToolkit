# Fluent

Make your api fluent.

This is based on Source Generator to create the extensions method for you to make your API fluent.

## Usage
### Quick Start
Create your own data type.
```c#
class Point
{
    public double X { get; set; }
    public double Y { get; set; }
    public void AddX(double x) => X += x;
}
```
And then, you can modify it by using the method `AsFluent`.
```c#
var point = new Point().AsFluent()
    .WithX(5)
    .DoAddX(6)
    .Result;
```
It'll make your Properties and Fields to the method `WithXXX`, and your method to `DoXXX`.
